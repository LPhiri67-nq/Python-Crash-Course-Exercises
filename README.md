<p id="description">The goal of this secondary repository is to document my learning journey and create a structured space for continuous improvement. Each exercise represents a step toward writing cleaner more efficient and more thoughtful Python code. By working through these exercises I’ve built a stronger foundation in Python and developed habits that translate into better coding practices overall. This repo serves as both a personal reference and a showcase of the skills I’ve developed so far.</p>

  
  
<h2> 🗂 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Python fundamentals: Variables data types operators and basic syntax.
*   Control flow: Loops conditionals and logical structures.
*   Functions & modular code: Reusable functions parameters return values and modules.
*   File handling & exceptions: Reading/writing files and managing errors gracefully.
*   Object‑oriented programming: Classes objects inheritance and encapsulation.
*   Algorithmic challenges: Problem‑solving exercises to build computational thinking.
*   Mini‑projects & practice scripts: Small practical programs reflecting real‑world scenarios.

         
This repository is open for anyone who wants to explore or practice core Python concepts. You are welcome to browse the exercises, run the scripts, or adapt the code to suit your own learning journey.
